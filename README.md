# angularjs-ninjalibrary-tutorial

This is a demo AngularJs application for learning the fundamentals.

# Note
- In a real world application you would organize your code much more for example your app.js. Different controller folders etc and no inline styles. This is a demo tutorial app anyway
- I used DARK READER extension for browser so the content is not going to be stylish.
- IT'S NOT A PROJECT SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING NICE!
